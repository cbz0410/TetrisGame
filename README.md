# TetrisGame

This is my second reverse-engineered classic game in Unity 2D: Tetris.

In this project, I learned some different aspects of Unity 2D development and strengthened a lot of my existing skills. 

Some of the skills I learned include:
-  Working with Tilemaps and Grids
-  Implementing sprites made outside of Unity
-  Step counters and timed movement
-  Enums and movement with complex models/structures
-  More UI Development

The most important skills that I strengthened were:
- Scripting
- Game Logic
- Utilizing Unity's features
- Handling input from the keyboard and movement
